# AI Core

Durable agent runtime, prompt governance, approval queues, and replay controls.

## What It Does Now

Acts as the durable control plane for agent execution, prompt governance, approval checkpoints, and replay-safe run state.

- Exports 3 governed actions: `ai.agent-runs.submit`, `ai.approvals.approve`, `ai.prompts.publish`.
- Owns 3 resource contracts: `ai.agent-runs`, `ai.prompt-versions`, `ai.approval-requests`.
- Adds richer admin workspace contributions on top of the base UI surface.
- Defines a durable data schema contract even though no explicit SQL helper module is exported.

## Maturity

**Maturity Tier:** `Baseline`

This tier is justified because unit coverage exists, and contract coverage exists.

## Verified Capability Summary

- Group: **AI Systems**
- Verification surface: **Build+Typecheck+Lint+Test+Contracts**
- Tests discovered: **3** total files across unit, contract lanes
- Integration model: **Actions+Resources+Jobs+UI**
- Database support: **postgres + sqlite**

## Quick Start For Integrators

Use this repo inside a **compatible Gutu workspace** or the **ecosystem certification workspace** so its `workspace:*` dependencies resolve honestly.

```bash
# from a compatible workspace that already includes this plugin's dependency graph
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run docs:check
```

```ts
import { manifest, submitAgentRunAction, AgentRunResource, adminContributions, uiSurface } from "@plugins/ai-core";

console.log(manifest.id);
console.log(submitAgentRunAction.id);
console.log(AgentRunResource.id);
```

Use the root repo scripts for day-to-day work **after the workspace is bootstrapped**, or run the nested package directly from `framework/builtin-plugins/ai-core` if you need lower-level control.

## Current Test Coverage

- Root verification scripts: `bun run build`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run test:contracts`, `bun run test:unit`, `bun run docs:check`
- Unit files: 2
- Contracts files: 1
- Integration files: 0
- Migrations files: 0

## Known Boundaries And Non-Goals

- Not an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink provider abstraction layer.
- Not a substitute for explicit approval, budgeting, and audit governance in the surrounding platform.
- Cross-plugin composition should use Gutu command, event, job, and workflow primitives. This repo should not be documented as exposing a generic WordPress-style hook system unless one is explicitly exported.

## Recommended Next Milestones

- Broaden provider adapters and richer operator diagnostics without weakening the current governance boundary.
- Add stronger persisted orchestration once long-running agent workflows leave the reference-runtime stage.
- Add deeper provider, persistence, or evaluation integrations only where the shipped control-plane contracts already prove stable.
- Expand operator diagnostics and release gating where the current lifecycle already exposes strong evidence paths.
- Add targeted integration coverage once the current lifecycle path is stable enough to benefit from end-to-end assertions.
- Add explicit migration or rollback coverage if this domain becomes more operationally sensitive.
- Promote important downstream reactions into explicit commands, jobs, or workflow steps instead of relying on implicit coupling.
