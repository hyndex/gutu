# AI Core Developer Guide

Durable agent runtime, prompt governance, approval queues, and replay controls.

**Maturity Tier:** `Baseline`

## Purpose And Architecture Role

Acts as the durable control plane for agent execution, prompt governance, approval checkpoints, and replay-safe run state.

### This plugin is the right fit when

- You need **agent runtime**, **approval queues**, **replay-safe execution** as a governed domain boundary.
- You want to integrate through declared actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and UI surfaces instead of implicit side effects.
- You need the host application to keep plugin boundaries honest through manifest capabilities, permissions, and verification lanes.

### This plugin is intentionally not

- Not an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink provider abstraction layer.
- Not a substitute for explicit approval, budgeting, and audit governance in the surrounding platform.

### UI Surface Summary

| Surface | Present | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI Surface | Yes | A bounded UI surface export is present. |
| Admin Contributions | Yes | Additional admin workspace contributions are exported. |
| Zone/Canvas Extension | No | No dedicated zone extension export. |

## Hooks, Events, And Orchestration

This plugin should be integrated through **explicit commands/actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and the surrounding Gutu event runtime**. It must **not** be documented as a generic WordPress-style hook system unless such a hook API is explicitly exported.

- No standalone plugin-owned lifecycle event feed is exported today.
- No plugin-owned job catalog is exported today.
- No plugin-owned workflow catalog is exported today.
- Recommended composition pattern: invoke actions, read resources, then let the surrounding Gutu command/event/job runtime handle downstream automation.

## Storage, Schema, And Migration Notes

- Database compatibility: `postgres`, `sqlite`
- Schema file: `framework/builtin-plugins/ai-core/db/schema.ts`
- SQL helper file: `framework/builtin-plugins/ai-core/src/postgres.ts`
- Migration lane present: No

The plugin does not export a dedicated SQL helper module today. Treat the schema and resources as the durable contract instead of inventing undocumented SQL behavior.

## Failure Modes And Recovery

- Action inputs can fail schema validation or permission evaluation before any durable mutation happens.
- If downstream automation is needed, the host must add it explicitly instead of assuming this plugin emits jobs.
- There is no separate lifecycle-event feed to rely on today; do not build one implicitly from internal details.
- Schema-affecting changes need extra care because there is no dedicated migration lane yet.

## Mermaid Flows

### Primary Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  caller["Host or operator"] --> action["ai.agent-runs.submit"]
  action --> validation["Schema + permission guard"]
  validation --> service["AI Core service layer"]
  service --> state["ai.agent-runs"]
  state --> ui["Admin contributions"]
```



## Integration Recipes

### 1. Host wiring

```ts
import { manifest, submitAgentRunAction, AgentRunResource, adminContributions, uiSurface } from "@plugins/ai-core";

export const pluginSurface = {
  manifest,
  submitAgentRunAction,
  AgentRunResource,
  
  
  adminContributions,
  uiSurface
};
```

Use this pattern when your host needs to register the plugin’s declared exports without reaching into internal file paths.

### 2. Action-first orchestration

```ts
import { manifest, submitAgentRunAction } from "@plugins/ai-core";

console.log("plugin", manifest.id);
console.log("action", submitAgentRunAction.id);
```

- Prefer action IDs as the stable integration boundary.
- Respect the declared permission, idempotency, and audit metadata instead of bypassing the service layer.
- Treat resource IDs as the read-model boundary for downstream consumers.

### 3. Cross-plugin composition

- Compose this plugin through action invocations and resource reads.
- If downstream automation becomes necessary, add it in the surrounding Gutu command/event/job runtime instead of assuming this plugin already exports a hook surface.

## Test Matrix

| Lane | Present | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Build | Yes | `bun run build` |
| Typecheck | Yes | `bun run typecheck` |
| Lint | Yes | `bun run lint` |
| Test | Yes | `bun run test` |
| Unit | Yes | 2 file(s) |
| Contracts | Yes | 1 file(s) |
| Integration | No | No integration files found |
| Migrations | No | No migration files found |

### Verification commands

- `bun run build`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run test:contracts`
- `bun run test:unit`
- `bun run docs:check`

## Current Truth And Recommended Next

### Current truth

- Exports 3 governed actions: `ai.agent-runs.submit`, `ai.approvals.approve`, `ai.prompts.publish`.
- Owns 3 resource contracts: `ai.agent-runs`, `ai.prompt-versions`, `ai.approval-requests`.
- Adds richer admin workspace contributions on top of the base UI surface.
- Defines a durable data schema contract even though no explicit SQL helper module is exported.

### Current gaps

- No dedicated integration test lane is exported in this repo today; validation currently leans on build, lint, typecheck, and test lanes.
- The plugin owns durable data state, but it does not yet ship a dedicated migration verification lane in this repo.
- No standalone plugin-owned event, job, or workflow catalog is exported yet; compose it through actions, resources, and the surrounding Gutu runtime.

### Recommended next

- Broaden provider adapters and richer operator diagnostics without weakening the current governance boundary.
- Add stronger persisted orchestration once long-running agent workflows leave the reference-runtime stage.
- Add deeper provider, persistence, or evaluation integrations only where the shipped control-plane contracts already prove stable.
- Expand operator diagnostics and release gating where the current lifecycle already exposes strong evidence paths.
- Add targeted integration coverage once the current lifecycle path is stable enough to benefit from end-to-end assertions.
- Add explicit migration or rollback coverage if this domain becomes more operationally sensitive.
- Promote important downstream reactions into explicit commands, jobs, or workflow steps instead of relying on implicit coupling.

### Later / optional

- Provider-specific optimization surfaces once the cross-provider contract has been battle-tested.
- More connector breadth, richer evaluation libraries, and domain-specific copilots after the baseline contracts settle.
