# Forms Core

Dynamic forms and submissions backbone.

## What It Does Now

Defines the dynamic form and submission layer used by internal tools, operator flows, and self-service data collection.

- Exports 1 governed action: `forms.submissions.submit`.
- Owns 1 resource contract: `forms.submissions`.
- Registers a bounded UI surface that can be hosted by the surrounding admin or portal shell.
- Defines a durable data schema contract even though no explicit SQL helper module is exported.

## Maturity

**Maturity Tier:** `Baseline`

This tier is justified because unit coverage exists, and contract coverage exists.

## Verified Capability Summary

- Group: **Content and Experience**
- Verification surface: **Build+Typecheck+Lint+Test+Contracts**
- Tests discovered: **2** total files across unit, contract lanes
- Integration model: **Actions+Resources+UI**
- Database support: **postgres + sqlite**

## Quick Start For Integrators

Use this repo inside a **compatible Gutu workspace** or the **ecosystem certification workspace** so its `workspace:*` dependencies resolve honestly.

```bash
# from a compatible workspace that already includes this plugin's dependency graph
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run docs:check
```

```ts
import { manifest, submitFormSubmissionAction, FormSubmissionResource, uiSurface } from "@plugins/forms-core";

console.log(manifest.id);
console.log(submitFormSubmissionAction.id);
console.log(FormSubmissionResource.id);
```

Use the root repo scripts for day-to-day work **after the workspace is bootstrapped**, or run the nested package directly from `framework/builtin-plugins/forms-core` if you need lower-level control.

## Current Test Coverage

- Root verification scripts: `bun run build`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run test:contracts`, `bun run test:unit`, `bun run docs:check`
- Unit files: 1
- Contracts files: 1
- Integration files: 0
- Migrations files: 0

## Known Boundaries And Non-Goals

- Not a monolithic website builder or headless-CMS replacement beyond the specific content surfaces exported here.
- Not a generic front-end framework; UI behavior remains bounded to the plugin’s declared resources and surfaces.
- Cross-plugin composition should use Gutu command, event, job, and workflow primitives. This repo should not be documented as exposing a generic WordPress-style hook system unless one is explicitly exported.

## Recommended Next Milestones

- Expand validation and workflow coupling where form submissions drive more downstream automation.
- Add stronger portal and dashboard integration guidance if form-driven products become more user-facing.
- Deepen publishing, review, search, or portal flows where current resources and actions already suggest the next stable step.
- Add richer admin and operator guidance once the domain lifecycle hardens.
- Add targeted integration coverage once the current lifecycle path is stable enough to benefit from end-to-end assertions.
- Add explicit migration or rollback coverage if this domain becomes more operationally sensitive.
- Promote important downstream reactions into explicit commands, jobs, or workflow steps instead of relying on implicit coupling.
- Broaden the admin entry surface only if operators need more than the current embedded view or resource listing.
