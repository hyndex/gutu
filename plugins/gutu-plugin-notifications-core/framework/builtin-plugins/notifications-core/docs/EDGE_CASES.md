# Notifications Core Edge Cases

## Known failure modes

- Validation or permission failures should stop at the action boundary instead of creating partial downstream state.
- If the service returns lifecycle events or jobs, hosts must treat those envelopes as part of the result contract and not silently drop them.
- Migration coverage exists; schema changes should keep that lane green.
- Admin contribution regressions can hide critical operator entrypoints even when the core action/resource contracts still compile.
- Downstream automation must not infer undocumented hooks or side effects from implementation details.

## Data anomalies

- Duplicate or replayed requests should be evaluated against the action’s documented idempotency behavior rather than guessed at runtime.
- Stale upstream dependencies should be handled by orchestration around this plugin, not by undocumented mutations inside the plugin boundary.
- If this plugin owns data that depends on another plugin, reconcile through declared dependencies and capability contracts.

## Recovery expectations

- Retry only through explicit action, job, or workflow semantics already exported by the plugin.
- Preserve auditability whenever operators need to reconcile a partial or conflicting state.
- Update both public and nested docs if recovery rules change.
