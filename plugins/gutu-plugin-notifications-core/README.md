# Notifications Core

Canonical outbound communication control plane with delivery endpoints, preferences, attempts, and local provider routes.

## What It Does Now

Operates as the outbound communication control plane for deterministic local delivery, endpoint governance, preference management, and auditable attempt history.

- Exports 6 governed actions: `notifications.delivery-endpoints.register`, `notifications.delivery-preferences.upsert`, `notifications.messages.queue`, `notifications.messages.retry`, `notifications.messages.cancel`, `notifications.messages.test-send`.
- Owns 4 resource contracts: `notifications.delivery-endpoints`, `notifications.delivery-preferences`, `notifications.messages`, `notifications.message-attempts`.
- Adds richer admin workspace contributions on top of the base UI surface.
- Ships explicit SQL migration or rollback helpers alongside the domain model.
- Service results already expose lifecycle events and follow-up jobs for orchestration-aware hosts.

## Maturity

**Maturity Tier:** `Production Candidate`

This tier is justified because unit coverage exists, contract coverage exists, integration coverage exists, migration coverage exists, and service results already carry orchestration signals.

## Verified Capability Summary

- Verification surface: **Build+Typecheck+Lint+Test+Contracts+Migrations+Integration**
- Tests discovered: **4** total files across unit, contract, integration, migration lanes
- Integration model: **Actions+Resources+Events+Jobs+UI**

## Quick Start For Integrators

Use this repo inside a **compatible Gutu workspace** or the **ecosystem certification workspace** so its `workspace:*` dependencies resolve honestly.

```bash
# from a compatible workspace that already includes this plugin's dependency graph
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run docs:check
```

```ts
import { manifest, registerDeliveryEndpointAction, NotificationDeliveryEndpointResource, adminContributions, uiSurface } from "@plugins/notifications-core";

console.log(manifest.id);
console.log(registerDeliveryEndpointAction.id);
console.log(NotificationDeliveryEndpointResource.id);
```

Use the root repo scripts for day-to-day work **after the workspace is bootstrapped**, or run the nested package directly from `framework/builtin-plugins/notifications-core` if you need lower-level control.

## Current Test Coverage

- Root verification scripts: `bun run build`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run test:contracts`, `bun run test:unit`, `bun run test:integration`, `bun run test:migrations`, `bun run docs:check`
- Unit files: 1
- Contracts files: 1
- Integration files: 1
- Migrations files: 1

## Known Boundaries And Non-Goals

- Not a full vertical application suite; this plugin only owns the domain slice exported in this repo.
- Not a replacement for explicit orchestration in jobs/workflows when multi-step automation is required.
- Does not currently ship live third-party connector packages in this repo.
- Does not export inbound email/SMS handling, campaigns, or marketing-automation workflows.
- Cross-plugin composition should use Gutu command, event, job, and workflow primitives. This repo should not be documented as exposing a generic WordPress-style hook system unless one is explicitly exported.

## Recommended Next Milestones

- Add live provider connectors and stronger long-running delivery reconciliation once the current local-provider contract is stable.
- Promote the current lifecycle events and dispatch flow into richer platform orchestration surfaces where downstream plugins need them.
- Broaden lifecycle coverage with deeper orchestration, reconciliation, and operator tooling where the business flow requires it.
- Add more explicit domain events or follow-up job surfaces when downstream systems need tighter coupling.
