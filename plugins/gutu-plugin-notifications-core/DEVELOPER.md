# Notifications Core Developer Guide

Canonical outbound communication control plane with delivery endpoints, preferences, attempts, and local provider routes.

**Maturity Tier:** `Production Candidate`

## Purpose And Architecture Role

Operates as the outbound communication control plane for deterministic local delivery, endpoint governance, preference management, and auditable attempt history.

### This plugin is the right fit when

- You need **message queueing**, **delivery attempts**, **endpoint and preference governance** as a governed domain boundary.
- You want to integrate through declared actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and UI surfaces instead of implicit side effects.
- You need the host application to keep plugin boundaries honest through manifest capabilities, permissions, and verification lanes.

### This plugin is intentionally not

- Not a full vertical application suite; this plugin only owns the domain slice exported in this repo.
- Not a replacement for explicit orchestration in jobs/workflows when multi-step automation is required.
- Does not currently ship live third-party connector packages in this repo.
- Does not export inbound email/SMS handling, campaigns, or marketing-automation workflows.

### UI Surface Summary

| Surface | Present | Notes |

| Zone/Canvas Extension | No | No dedicated zone extension export. |

## Hooks, Events, And Orchestration

This plugin should be integrated through **explicit commands/actions, resources, jobs, workflows, and the surrounding Gutu event runtime**. It must **not** be documented as a generic WordPress-style hook system unless such a hook API is explicitly exported.

- Service results already return lifecycle event envelopes. Hosts should treat those envelopes as explicit orchestration outputs, not as incidental metadata.
- Job surface: service-returned follow-up jobs.
- No plugin-owned workflow catalog is exported today.
- Recommended composition pattern: invoke actions, read resources, then let the surrounding Gutu command/event/job runtime handle downstream automation.

## Storage, Schema, And Migration Notes

- Database compatibility: `postgres`, `sqlite`
- Schema file: `framework/builtin-plugins/notifications-core/db/schema.ts`
- SQL helper file: `framework/builtin-plugins/notifications-core/src/postgres.ts`
- Migration lane present: Yes

The plugin ships explicit SQL helper exports. Use those helpers as the truth source for database migration or rollback expectations.

## Failure Modes And Recovery

- Action inputs can fail schema validation or permission evaluation before any durable mutation happens.
- Hosts that ignore returned job envelopes may lose required downstream processing.
- Hosts that ignore returned lifecycle events may lose traceability or follow-up orchestration.
- Schema regressions are expected to show up in the migration lane and should block shipment.

## Mermaid Flows

### Primary Lifecycle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  caller["Host or operator"] --> action["notifications.delivery-endpoints.register"]
  action --> validation["Schema + permission guard"]
  validation --> service["Notifications Core service layer"]
  service --> state["notifications.delivery-endpoints"]
  service --> events["Lifecycle event envelopes"]
  service --> jobs["Follow-up jobs / queue definitions"]
  state --> ui["Admin contributions"]
```



## Integration Recipes

### 1. Host wiring

```ts
import { manifest, registerDeliveryEndpointAction, NotificationDeliveryEndpointResource, adminContributions, uiSurface } from "@plugins/notifications-core";

export const pluginSurface = {
  manifest,
  registerDeliveryEndpointAction,
  NotificationDeliveryEndpointResource,
  
  
  adminContributions,
  uiSurface
};
```

Use this pattern when your host needs to register the plugin’s declared exports without reaching into internal file paths.

### 2. Action-first orchestration

```ts
import { manifest, registerDeliveryEndpointAction } from "@plugins/notifications-core";

console.log("plugin", manifest.id);
console.log("action", registerDeliveryEndpointAction.id);
```

- Prefer action IDs as the stable integration boundary.
- Respect the declared permission, idempotency, and audit metadata instead of bypassing the service layer.
- Treat resource IDs as the read-model boundary for downstream consumers.

### 3. Cross-plugin composition

- Treat actions as the write boundary and jobs as the asynchronous follow-up boundary.
- Use the exported job definitions or returned job envelopes instead of inventing hidden background work.
- Keep retries and queue semantics outside the plugin only when the plugin does not already export them.

## Current Truth And Recommended Next

### Current truth

- Exports 6 governed actions: `notifications.delivery-endpoints.register`, `notifications.delivery-preferences.upsert`, `notifications.messages.queue`, `notifications.messages.retry`, `notifications.messages.cancel`, `notifications.messages.test-send`.
- Owns 4 resource contracts: `notifications.delivery-endpoints`, `notifications.delivery-preferences`, `notifications.messages`, `notifications.message-attempts`.
- Adds richer admin workspace contributions on top of the base UI surface.
- Ships explicit SQL migration or rollback helpers alongside the domain model.
- Service results already expose lifecycle events and follow-up jobs for orchestration-aware hosts.

### Current gaps

- No extra gaps were discovered beyond the plugin’s declared boundaries.

### Recommended next

- Add live provider connectors and stronger long-running delivery reconciliation once the current local-provider contract is stable.
- Promote the current lifecycle events and dispatch flow into richer platform orchestration surfaces where downstream plugins need them.
- Broaden lifecycle coverage with deeper orchestration, reconciliation, and operator tooling where the business flow requires it.
- Add more explicit domain events or follow-up job surfaces when downstream systems need tighter coupling.

### Later / optional

- Campaign tooling, inbound processing, and broader provider governance after the transactional substrate has matured.
- Outbound connectors, richer analytics, or portal-facing experiences once the core domain contracts harden.
