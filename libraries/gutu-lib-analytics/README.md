## What It Does Now

- Publishes 0 public modules from `@platform/analytics`.
- Exports 16 named symbols through the public entrypoint, including `packageId`, `packageDisplayName`, `packageDescription`, `defineMetric`, `defineSegment`, `createMetricRegistry`, and more.
- Keeps the public surface headless and import-driven rather than requiring a UI runtime.
- Verification lanes present: Build+Typecheck+Lint+Test.

## Maturity

**Maturity Tier:** `Hardened`

Why this tier:
- Group: **Core Data And Query**
- Public modules: 0
- Named exports: 16
- Test files: 1
- Contract lane: not present

## Quick Start For Integrators

Use this repo inside a **compatible Gutu workspace** or the **ecosystem certification workspace** so its `workspace:*` dependencies resolve honestly.

```bash
# from a compatible workspace that already includes this library's dependency graph
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run docs:check
```

```ts
import { packageId, packageDisplayName, defineMetric } from "@platform/analytics";

console.log(packageId, packageDisplayName, typeof defineMetric);
```

Use the root repo scripts for day-to-day work after the workspace is bootstrapped, or run the nested package directly from `framework/libraries/analytics` if you need lower-level control.

## Current Test Coverage

- `bun run build`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run docs:check`
- `bun run test:unit`
- Unit files: 1
- Contract files: 0
- Integration files: 0
- Migration files: 0

## Known Boundaries And Non-Goals

- Not a vertical application or domain plugin by itself.
- Not a generic hook bus or hidden orchestration layer.
- This library should be consumed through explicit imports, providers, callbacks, and typed helpers rather than undocumented global hooks.

## Recommended Next Milestones

- Strengthen contract coverage around the most widely consumed helper surfaces.
- Add deeper integration examples where downstream packages repeatedly compose the same APIs.
- Add contract-focused tests around the most reused public modules and exported helpers.
