## What It Does Now

- Publishes 1 public module from `@platform/admin-builders`: `./main`.
- Exports 13 named symbols through the public entrypoint, including `packageId`, `packageDisplayName`, `packageDescription`, `createBuilderPanelLayout`, `createBuilderPublishContract`, `assertBuilderRevision`, and more.
- Uses a React-aware surface model: Mixed runtime helpers.
- Verification lanes present: Build+Typecheck+Lint+Test.

## Quick Start For Integrators

Use this repo inside a **compatible Gutu workspace** or the **ecosystem certification workspace** so its `workspace:*` dependencies resolve honestly.

```bash
# from a compatible workspace that already includes this library's dependency graph
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run docs:check
```

```ts
import { packageId, packageDisplayName, createBuilderPanelLayout } from "@platform/admin-builders";

console.log(packageId, packageDisplayName, typeof createBuilderPanelLayout);
```

Use the root repo scripts for day-to-day work after the workspace is bootstrapped, or run the nested package directly from `framework/libraries/admin-builders` if you need lower-level control.

## Current Test Coverage

- `bun run build`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run docs:check`
- `bun run test:unit`
- Unit files: 1
- Contract files: 0
- Integration files: 0
- Migration files: 0

## Known Boundaries And Non-Goals

- Not a full product shell or admin application by itself.
- Not a replacement for plugin-owned business logic or data lifecycles.
- This library should be consumed through explicit imports, providers, callbacks, and typed helpers rather than undocumented global hooks.

## Recommended Next Milestones

- Deepen contract coverage around the most reused admin composition paths.
- Add stronger ergonomic guidance where multiple first-party plugins compose the same admin primitives.
- Add contract-focused tests around the most reused public modules and exported helpers.
- Add richer interaction or rendering checks around the primary React-facing exports where hosts depend on them heavily.
- Keep compatibility examples current as more extracted repos consume this library through the workspace vendor model.
