## What It Does Now

- Publishes 0 public modules from `@platform/ui-zone-static`.
- Exports 4 named symbols through the public entrypoint, including `packageId`, `packageDisplayName`, `packageDescription`, `createStaticZone`.
- Keeps the public surface headless and import-driven rather than requiring a UI runtime.
- Verification lanes present: Build+Typecheck+Lint+Test.

## Maturity

**Maturity Tier:** `Baseline`

Why this tier:
- Group: **UI Foundation**
- Public modules: 0
- Named exports: 4
- Test files: 1
- Contract lane: not present

## Quick Start For Integrators

Use this repo inside a **compatible Gutu workspace** or the **ecosystem certification workspace** so its `workspace:*` dependencies resolve honestly.

```bash
# from a compatible workspace that already includes this library's dependency graph
bun install
bun run build
bun run test
bun run docs:check
```

```ts
import { packageId, packageDisplayName, createStaticZone } from "@platform/ui-zone-static";

console.log(packageId, packageDisplayName, typeof createStaticZone);
```

Use the root repo scripts for day-to-day work after the workspace is bootstrapped, or run the nested package directly from `framework/libraries/ui-zone-static` if you need lower-level control.

## Current Test Coverage

- `bun run build`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun run lint`
- `bun run test`
- `bun run docs:check`
- `bun run test:unit`
- Unit files: 1
- Contract files: 0
- Integration files: 0
- Migration files: 0

## Known Boundaries And Non-Goals

- Not a complete front-end application by itself.
- Not a replacement for app-level state, routing, or domain-specific orchestration.
- This library should be consumed through explicit imports, providers, callbacks, and typed helpers rather than undocumented global hooks.

## Recommended Next Milestones

- Add stronger component and interaction verification around the most reused visual primitives.
- Deepen accessibility and composition guidance where multiple host apps depend on the same library.
- Keep compatibility examples current as more extracted repos consume this library through the workspace vendor model.
